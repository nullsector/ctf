# PAN LabyREnth CTF 2016: Windows Level 4 - JugsOfBeer

## Write-up
This is a 64-bit Windows Gui file. I used x64dbg to do my reversing on this challenge. This challenge is based on the jugs of
water riddle that was in the movie Die Hard with a Vengence. This riddle has 3 "jugs of beer", one is 7 gallons, one is 13 gallons,
and the last one is 19 gallons. The 7 and 13 gallon jugs start full, and you need to get 10 gallons in the 19 gallon jug, and 10 gallons
in the 13 gallon jug.
